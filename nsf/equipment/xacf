      <br><pre>[1] Product evaluated, tested, and Listed by NSF International for use as a flow measurement
    device.  Materials were evaluated for toxicological health safety and corrosion
    resistance in accordance with NSF/ANSI Standard 50.  Fasteners were evaluated and tested
    in accordance with NSF/ANSI Standard 50 and ANSI/APSP-16.  Product was tested for
    pressure loss (head loss) with both 2.0" and 2.5" SCH 40 PVC piping in accordance with
    NSF/ANSI Standard 50.  Product was tested for hydrostatic pressure strength at 1.5x
    working pressure of 50 psi in accordance with NSF/ANSI Standard 50.  Product was tested
    for cyclical pressure strength testing via 20,000 cycles of 0-30 psi-0 in accordance
    with NSF/ANSI Standard 50.  Product was tested for burst sustained pressure at 2.0x
    working pressure of 100 psi in accordance with NSF/ANSI Standard 50.  Product was tested
    for failure burst safety at more than 4.0x working pressure (over 400 psi).  Product was
    tested in three (3) physical orientations (flow meter positioned horizontally,
    vertically flowing upward, and vertically flowing downward).  Product was tested in two
    (2) piping configurations both long straight runs (20x nominal pipe diameter) of piping
    before and after the flow meter, and tested with elbows installed immediately before and
    after the flow meter.   Product tested for accuracy with both 2.0" SCH 40 PVC, and 2.5"
    SCH 40 PVC piping.  Product yielded Level 1 accuracy under all conditions of testing. 
    To achieve level 1 (L1) flow meter accuracy rating, the average of testing results
    across the manufacturers claimed full scale of flow rate must be within 5% of actual
    flow rate.  The greatest deviation of any one tested flow rate from the actual shall be
    no greater than 7.5% at a tested flow rate.
