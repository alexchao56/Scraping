<pre>[1] These products are designed to be flushed out prior to using the system for drinking
    water. Before being placed into service, the well is to be properly flushed according to
    the manufacturer's use instructions. Certification of these products is based on the
    well drilling model with the following assumptions:
    - The amount of well drilling fluid is 3780 L (1000 U.S. gallons) to which the drilling 
      fluid has been added at the manufacturer's recommended level. 
    - The aquifer contains 3.1 million liters of water (815,000 gallons) based on a 0.5 acre
    
      aquifer of 6.1 meter depth (20 ft.) and 25% porosity.
    - The bore hole is 61 meters in total depth (200 ft.), the screen is 6.1 meters in
    length 
      (20 ft.), and the bore hole is 25.4 cm in diameter (10 in.).
    - The amount of well drilling fluid removed from the well during construction is equal
    to 
      the combined volumes of the casing and the screen, plus an additional amount removed 
      through the well disinfection and development (90% removed). 
    - This product should not be used in constructing wells in highly porous formations,
    such
      as cavernous limestone. 
    
[2] Certification of this product is based on a well drilling model using assumption in
    NSF/ANSI Standard 60, Section 8 for well drilling foamers.
[3] This product is designed to be used off-line and flushed prior to using the system for
    drinking water, following manufacturer's use instructions.
[4] This product is designed to be flusehd out until the turbidity of the water is <1
    NTU.F;lusing is required before the system may be used for drinking water.
