<pre>[1] This product functions as a well drilling additive and may be added at 0.1 - 0.3% to
    drilling mud for fresh water applications.
[2] This product is designed to be flushed out prior to using the system for drinking water.
    Before being placed into service, the well is to be properly flushed according to the
    manufacturer's use instructions. Certification of these products is based on the well
    drilling model with the following assumptions: 
    - The amount of well drilling fluid used is 3780 L (1000 U.S. gallons) to which the
    drilling fluid has been added at the manufacturer's recommended level. 
    - The aquifer contains 3.1 million liters of water (815,000 gallons) based on a 0.5 acre
    aquifer of 6.1 meter depth (20 ft.) and 25% porosity. 
    - The bore hole is 61 meters in total depth (200 ft.), the screen is 6.1 meters in
    length (20 ft.), and the bore hole is 25.4 cm. in diameter (10 in.). 
    - The amount of well drilling fluid removed from the well during construction is equal
    to the combined volumes of the casing and the screen, plus an additional amount removed
    through the well disinfection and development (90% removed). 
    - This product should not be used in constructing wells in highly porous formations,
    such as cavernous limestone.
